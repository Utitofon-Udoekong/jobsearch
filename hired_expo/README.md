# Hired Job Search App

The Hired Job Search App is a React Native app that helps users search for job opportunities using the JSearch API on Rapid API. With this app, users can search for jobs based on different criteria, such as job title, location, and company. The app is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

Some of the key features of the Hired Job Search App include:

- Job search by job title, location, and company.
- View job details, such as the job description, requirements, and company information.
- Save job listings for later viewing.
- Apply for jobs directly from the app.

## Installation

To use the Hired Job Search App, you will need to have Expo CLI installed on your machine. You can install it by following the instructions on the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

Once you have Expo CLI installed, you can clone the repository and install the required dependencies by running the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/Utitofon-Udoekong/hired.git
cd hired
npm install

Next, you will need to obtain an API key from Rapid API to access the JSearch API. You can sign up for a free account on the [Rapid API website](https://rapidapi.com/) and obtain an API key for the JSearch API.

Once you have your API key, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add the following line, replacing `{YOUR_API_KEY}` with your actual API key:

JSEARCH_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}

## Usage

To run the app on an Android or iOS simulator or physical device, you can use the following commands:

expo start

This will start the Expo development server and open the Expo client in your browser. From there, you can choose to run the app on an Android or iOS simulator or scan the QR code with the Expo client app on your physical device.

For more information on running the app with Expo, refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).
